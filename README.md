Project Description

The Electronic Sales Dashboard project aims to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance across different customer and product segments. Using Power BI, this dashboard consolidates key metrics like revenue, profit, and profit margin while presenting detailed breakdowns by product type, age group, gender, and loyalty membership. This consolidated view helps decision-makers understand the sales landscape and identify trends that can guide strategy.

Project Goals

Identify High-Performing Products: Pinpoint which product categories contribute most to revenue and profit.

Understand Customer Demographics: Analyze sales data by age, gender, and loyalty status to reveal customer preferences.

Monitor Sales Trends Over Time: Track average order value trends to identify seasonal patterns or peak sales periods.

Optimize Marketing and Inventory: Use insights to better target marketing efforts and manage stock levels efficiently.

Business Needs

To remain competitive, the business needs a clear understanding of customer preferences and product performance. Key questions include:

Which products drive the most revenue and profit?

Who are the primary customers in terms of age, gender, and loyalty status?

Are there seasonal or periodic spikes in sales that can inform promotional timing?

Discovering and Presenting Insights

Data Analysis: Start by cleaning and organizing the data to ensure accuracy. Analyze each metric (e.g., revenue by product, customer segment) to find patterns.

Data Visualization: Use Power BI visualizations like cards, bar charts, and line charts to clearly communicate findings.

Highlight Trends: Focus on key patterns, such as revenue peaks, high-performing products, and demographic insights. Include insights on profit margins, customer loyalty impacts, and any significant seasonal fluctuations.

Actionable Recommendations: Summarize findings in a way that drives action, such as recommending product focus areas, target demographics for marketing, and optimal timing for promotions.
